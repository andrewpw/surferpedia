Overview
--------

A [Play Application](http://playframework.com) that provides an encyclopedia of surfers.


Installation
------------

Download the zip file, unzip and cd into the file. Invoke the play command and execute the run command to see the 
application at http://localhost9000

Usage
-----

Use the new tab to create a new entry for a surfer
You must sign in as the admin to create new surfers, and edit or delete content
For the sake of testing purposes, admin login is username: admin@example.com password: password
Each surfer must have a unique slug and that slug can be used to retrieve their page by adding it to the end of the URL
Surfers pages can be accessed by searching for them - if you do not specify any surfer attributes in the search bar,
all surfers are displayed.
Surfers can be rated by anyone.  Currently the surfers rating does not display.
Once you choose a slug you cannot change it
